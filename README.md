# Cake App

Welcome to the Cake App! This project is a simple React application designed to help me learn how to integrate Redux with React. Through this app, I gain hands-on experience in managing state using Redux in a React environment.

## Features

- **Cake state Management:** Updating the state of the app to understand state management with Redux.
- **Redux Integration:** Learn how to connect Redux with React components and manage the application's state effectively.

## Getting Started

I followed these steps to set up and run the project on my local machine:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TomLayan1/Cake-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd Cake-app/cake-app
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command returns the localhost URL [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5157). I navigate to the URL to launch the app in my default web browser.

## Project Structure

The project's structure is organized as follows:

```

└── README.md           # Project documentation
```

## Learnings

Through building this app, I learnt:

- How to set up Redux in a React project.
- Creating actions and reducers to manage state.
- Connecting React components to the Redux store.
- Understanding the flow of data in a React-Redux application.
